# ANP Setup
* Log onto the ANP server (Linode AlmaLinux v8 ANP Test Server)
* Create a directory in `/u/newslayout/moai/settings` that matches the Scoop username for whom you are setting up ANP (anp_demo, mmacdonald, etc)
* Create a file `default_settings.json` in the above directory. Its contents should be as follows:
```bash
    {
        "products": {
            "<productmanager_productname>": "<scoop_product_name>"
        },
        "ANPStatus": "<scoop_anp_status>",
        "version": "<anp_version>"
    }
```
    Where:
        `<productmanager_productname>` is the ProductManager "productname" (i.e. DGEDG)
        `<scoop_product_name>` is the Product's name in DatabaseManager (i.e. Dodge City Globe)
        `<scoop_anp_status>` is the string of the status in Scoop that signifies an ANP product is ready (i.e. ANP Pagination)
        `<anp_version>` is the ANP engine version to use (found in /u/newslayout/moai/versions) (i.e. 20230217)
* Copy an existing JSON file from another user's directory for each `<scoop_product_name>` configured. These files must be named `<scoop_product_name>.json` (i.e. 'Dodge City Globe.json')
* Adjust settings as needed. The following provides a summary of the important sections in the JSON file:
    
    `priorities`: a dictionary of Scoop priorities matched to a priority number (higher number is higher on the page)
    
    `pages`: a list of dictionaries for ANP pages that specify specific settings for that page
            `num`: the number of the page
            `vrules/hrules`: accepts "ads-ads", "ads-stories", "stories-stories" and will create vrules/hrules between the specified options (i.e. between two ads, between an ad and a story, between two stories)
            `allowjumps`: allow jumps from this page
            `receivejumps`: allow jumps to this page
    
    `jumps`: a list of dictionaries that specify jump configurations
    
    `styles`: a list of dictionaries that specify style configurations
    
    `templates`: a list of dictionaries that specify style information (also referred to as GLAs - Grid Level Abstractions)
            `group`: the groups that are allowed to use this template ("ALL GROUPS" is a special catch-all group)
            `grid`: the grid that defines this template
            `<grid_letter>`: the style this grid letter should use
    
            For example, the last two options may be configured as:
```bash
                    "grid": [
                            "ACC",
                            "BBC"
                    ],
                    "A": "style1",
                    "B": "style2",
                    "C": "style3"
```
            The above would allow story A to be placed on the page above story B and have C to the right of both A and B, possibly spanning the height of both.
    
            Note: grids specify layout, not size. In the above example, story A is not 1/3 of the page's width and 1/2 of the page's height. The grid merely specifies where stories may be placed in relation to eachother.

TODO:
Marty

* Test with ad images and Scoop images
* Set up GLAs
    * On "Linode AlmaLinux v8 ANP Test Server":
        * cd /u/newslayout/moai/settings/mmacdonald/
        * nano "Fort Pierce (TC).json"
        * 

Ethan

* Configure Layout to output to Scoop (/u/pagetrack/AdFiles/OUTEXT)
    * Either through "Remote Copy" or a one time inotify script
