## Creating symbolic link between versions of WebEdit
Create a symbolic link between versions in the WebEdit folder.
```shell
cd /usr/share/webedit
```

The link command will allow the older version to server as the version that matches the current server version number.

```shell
ln -l <oldVersion> <newVersion>
```
