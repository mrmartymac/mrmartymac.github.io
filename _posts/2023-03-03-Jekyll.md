# Regular updates

To build and update the http://localhost site on my MacBook Pro, open **Terminal**

```shell
cd /Users/martinmacdonald/Documents/GitHub/mrmartymac.github.io
./jeklyy.sh
```

# Creating a new site

```shell
jekyll new <siteName>
cd <siteName>
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Later instances using `jekyll serve` will do.  This will keep a session running to update the site if changes are made.  Alternatively you can use the command below to just build the site contents and not watch for new changes.

```shell
bundle exec jekyll build
```
