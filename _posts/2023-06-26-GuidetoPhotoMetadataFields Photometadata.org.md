Our "Field Guide" provides a valuable resource for photo metadata users. It lists and defines the most commonly used fields in key metadata schema and in popular software.

If you are trying to compare what fields labels are matches between various applications (like Photoshop, Lightroom, Bridge or iView), you may find the charts in the [_"IPTC Core Mapped Fields"_](http://www.controlledvocabulary.com/imagedatabases/iptc_core_mapped.pdf "IPTC Core Mapped Fields PDF on the ControlledVocabulary.com website") PDF, (available from the [ControlledVocabulary.com](http://www.controlledvocabulary.com/ "ControlledVocabulary.com website") website) to be helpful.

**City (legacy)** \[IPTC Core\]

Enter the name of the city where the image was captured. If there is no city, you can use the Sublocation field alone to specify where the photograph was made. City is at the third level of a top-down geographical hierarchy.

**City (of Location Created)** \[IPTC Extension\]

Use this field to record the name of the city of the location which is shown in the image. This element is at the fourth level of a top-down geographical hierarchy.

**Contact Info** \[IPTC Core\]  
The Contact Info fields provide a generic structure for storing basic information that should make it easy to reach the person or organization that created this image. Note: "City," "State" and "Country" used in Contact Info should not be confused with fields bearing the same names that refer to the picture's origin.

> **Address (Contact info)**

> Enter the URL or web address for your business. Separate multiple addresses with commas.

**  
Copyright Notice** \[IPTC Core\]  
The Copyright Notice should include any legal language required to claim intellectual property. It should identify the photograph's current holder(s). If the photographer differs from the copyright holder, enter the photographer's name in the Creator field. Usually, the value for this copyright notice would be the photographer, but if an employee made the image under work-for-hire rules, then list the employing agency or company.

Use the form of notice appropriate to your country.

For the United States, you would typically follow the form of ©<date of first publication> name of copyright owner, as in “©2012 John Doe.” Note the word “copyright” or the abbreviation “copr” may be used in place of the © symbol. In some foreign countries only the copyright symbol is recognized and the abbreviation is not accepted. Note the copyright symbol must be a full circle with a “c” inside; using something such as (c), where the parentheses form a partial circle, is not sufficient. For additional protection worldwide, it's best to use of the phrase, “all rights reserved” following the notice, as in: ©2012 Jane Doe, all rights reserved."

In Europe you use: Copyright {Year} {Copyright owner}, all rights reserved.

In Japan, for maximum protection, the following three items should appear in the copyright field of the IPTC Core: (a) the word, Copyright; (b) year of the first publication; and (c) name of the author. You may also wish to include the phrase “all rights reserved.”

Notes on usage rights should be provided in the “Rights Usage Terms” field.

_Note: This field is “shared” with the “Copyright Notice” field in the Description panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info field._

_U.S. Examples:  
Independent Photographer -_ ©2012 John Doe, all rights reserved_Agency Photographer -_ ©2012 John Doe / XYZ Agency, all rights reserved_Staff Photographer -_ ©2008 Big Newspaper, all rights reserved

This field is not part of the IPTC Core; it exists only as part of the Photoshop XMP Namespace. Use with caution, as some software programs will not recognize this field.

**Copyright Owner (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
This field can be used to indicate the owner or owners of the copyright in the licensed image by name and identifier. This serves to identify the rights holder/s for the image. The Copyright Owner, Image Creator, Image Source and Licensor may be the same or different entities. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Copyright URL** \[Photoshop\]  
This field is not part of the IPTC Core; it exists only as part of the Photoshop XMP Namespace. Use with caution, as some software programs will not recognize this field.

**Country (legacy)** \[IPTC Core\]

Note: This field is “shared” with the “Country” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info field._

**Country Code (legacy)** \[IPTC Core\]  
Enter the Country Code of the country pictured in the photograph. This field is at the top level of a top-down geographical hierarchy. Display country codes as upper-case letters (US not us). They may be either two- or three-letter codes, as defined by the ISO 3166 standard. The two-letter code list (3166-2) is freely available from the [International Standards Organization](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/country_names_and_code_elements.htm "International Standards Organization") site. The full name of a country should go to the “Country” field.

**Country Code (of Location Created)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the ISO country code of the location where the image was created. This element is at the second level of a top-down geographical hierarchy. Country codes should be displayed as upper-case letters (US not us), and may be either two- or three-letter codes as defined by the ISO 3166 standard. The two-letter code (3166-2) is freely available from the [International Standards Organization](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/country_names_and_code_elements.htm "International Standards Organization") site. The full name of a country should go to the “Country Name” field.

**Country Code (of Location Shown)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the ISO country code of the location which is shown in the image. This element is at the second level of a top-down geographical hierarchy. Country codes should be displayed as upper-case letters (US not us), and may be either two- or three-letter codes as defined by the ISO 3166 standard. The two-letter code (3166-2) is freely available from the [International Standards Organization](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/country_names_and_code_elements.htm "International Standards Organization") site. The full name of a country should go to the “Country Name” field.

**Country Name (of Location Created)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the full name of the country of the location where the image was created. The full name should be expressed as a verbal name and not as a code, the ISO country code should be placed in the field titled Country Code. This element is at the second level of a top-down geographical hierarchy.

**Country Name (of Location Shown)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Enter the full name of the country which is shown in the photograph. The full name should be expressed as a verbal name and not as a code, the ISO country code should be placed in the field titled Country Code. This element is at the second level of a top-down geographical hierarchy.

**Creator** \[IPTC Core\]  
This field should contain your name or the name of the person who created the photograph. If it is not appropriate to add the name of the photographer (for example, the photographer's identity needs to be protected) use a company or organization name. Once saved, this field should not be changed by anyone. _  
Note: This field is "shared" with the “Author” field in the Description Panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

**Creator’s Job Title** \[IPTC Core\]  
This field should list the job title of the photographer. Examples might include: Staff Photographer, Freelance Photographer or Independent Commercial Photographer. Since this is a qualifier for the Creator field, you must also complete the Creator field._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Author Title” field in the Description Panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue (only appears in versions of Adobe products later than CS)._

**Creator (of Artwork/Object)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the name of the artist who has created artwork or others objects that are in the image and may have associated intellectual property rights. In cases where the artist cannot or should not be identified, the name of a company or organisation may be used if appropriate.

**Credit Line** \[IPTC Core\]  
The Credit Line is a free-text field that specifies how to acknowledge the supplying person(s) and/or organization(s) when publishing the image. Indicate more formal identifications of the image's creator or the copyright holder in other rights-specific fields - such as Creator and Copyright Notice. The older IIM metadata schema called this property "Credit." It was renamed to "Provider" in IPTC Core 1.0. It has been renamed to “Credit Line” in the latest version of the IPTC Core 1.1 to acknowledge how it is most widely used._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Credit” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

_Examples:  
Independent Photographer -_ John Doe Photography_Agency Photographer -_ XYZ Agency_Staff Photographer -_ Big Newspaper

**Date Created** \[IPTC Core\]  
Use this field to record the calendar date (and optionally, the time) when the photograph was made - not the date when you scanned or edited the image. If using a digital camera set to the correct time, you can find this information in the image's EXIF data. If no time is given, the value should default to 00:00:00._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Date Created” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue. You can use the Origin panel’s “Today" button to set the IPTC Date Created field._

**Date Created (of Artwork/Object)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this date field to designate the date (and optionally the time) that artwork or objects in the image were created. This option should only be used when you need to identify paintings, sculptures or other artwork or objects that have associated intellectual property rights of their own. Please note that historical dates can be handled differently by different operating systems. For historical dates it may be advisable to enter the date also in the description field. Also note that partial dates, e.g. just the year, may also read differently. Do not confuse this field value with the Date Created field that is part of the IPTC Core and IIM metadata. Be aware that how this field can be used highly depends on the user interface control used by the software maker. By the XMP specifications these alternative inputs should be supported by the control: - a year only (may be used for historic photos); - a year and a month only (may be used for photos with an unclear day of the date); - a full date (year and month and day); - a full date with a time, including a time zone. If only a date is given, no time or time zone information needs to be added. If you are entering a time, you should include the time zone as well. If no time is available the value should default to an empty time part and not to the time 00:00:00.

**Description** \[IPTC Core\]  
The Description field, often referred to as “Caption,” should report the who, what and why of what the photograph depicts. If there is a person or people in the image, this caption might include their names, and/or their roles in any action taking place. If the image depicts a location, then it should describe the location. Don’t forget to also include this same “geographical” information in the appropriate fields (location, city, state/province, country) of the IPTC Core. The amount of detail to include depends on the image and whether it is documentary or conceptual. Typically, editorial images come with complete caption text, while advertising images may not._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Description” field in the Description panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

_Editorial Example:_  
TheShore Temple of the Seven Pagodas was built underNarsimha II of the Pallava dynasty between 7th and 8th century AD and is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It resembles the structure of the Dharmaraja rath, but its tower rises much higher (approx. five stories or ~ 60 ft. high) and its stupa spire is small and slender.

_Advertising Example:_  
Paper tissue roll core, photographed upright.

**Description writer** \[IPTC Core\]  
Enter the name of the person writing, editing or correcting the description of the photograph in this field. If you're an independent photographer, this is typically your own name, since you are entering the image metadata._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Description Writer” field in the Description panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

**Digital Source Type** \[IPTC Extension\]  
This field is a controlled value list that can be used to indicate from what type of source the digital image was created. The corresponding vocabulary, provided by the IPTC, includes these values:

-   Original digital capture of a real life scene – should be used for all shots of real-life, including at photo studios
-   Digitised from a negative on film – should be used with b&w or colour negatives from film scanners
-   Digitised from a positive on film – should be used with slides or transparencies from film scanners
-   Digitised from a print on non-transparent medium – should be used with flat-bed scanners or any special document capturing cameras.
-   Created by software –should be used for all kinds of computer generated images (CGI), such as images composited from several different photos and/or graphic elements, or images created entirely in the computer.

The reference for this CV can be found in the [Newscodes section of the IPTC website](http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/).

**Document Title** \[IPTC Core\]  
Alternative label for "[Title](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata#Title)."

**Event** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to name or describe the specific event at which the photo was taken. Rather than use generic terms such as: press conference, race or festival; be specific and write, Archimedes press conference, The Great Steamboat Race, or Maui Classical Music Festival. This could make it easier to locate the image later. If this is a sub-event of a larger event both can be provided in the field: e.g. XXXIX Olympic Summer Games (Beijing): opening ceremony.

**Featured Organisation Code** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to note a Code from a known controlled vocabulary for identifying the organisation or company which is featured in the image. As one example, you could list the stock ticker symbol such as MSFT (Microsoft) or ADBE (Adobe). PTC Extension provides two fields for this purpose. They can be used to identify an organisation by its name and/or by a code (or identifier) used by e.g. a stocks exchange. But these two fields are not strictly linked, that means one cannot indicate “this company has the name ACME and its stock exchange ID NACME” in a single input row, these values can only be input independently. However, searching for photos of a company will work in any case, one need only decide whether to search by name or by code.

**Featured Organisation Name** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to indicate the full name of the organisation or company which is featured in the image. You may wish to supplement this information using values from a controlled vocabulary which are stored in the Organisation Code field (see below). PTC Extension provides two fields for this purpose. They can be used to identify an organisation by its name and/or by a code (or identifier) used by e.g. a stocks exchange. But these two fields are not strictly linked, that means one cannot indicate “this company has the name ACME and its stock exchange ID NACME” in a single input row, these values can only be input independently. However, searching for photos of a company will work in any case, one need only decide whether to search by name or by code. .

**Headline** \[IPTC Core\]  
A headline is a brief, publishable synopsis or summary of the contents of the photograph. Like a news story's lead, the Headline should grab attention and summarize the image's content. Headlines must be succinct. Leave any supporting narrative for the Description field. Do not, however, confuse the Headline term with Title._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Headline” field in the Origin Panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

_Examples:_  
Young boy yelling  
Shore Temple, Malibalipuram, India  
Farmer planting onions

**Image Creator (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
This field can be used to indicate the creator or creators of the image by both name and identifier. The creator can be expressed in free-text using the IPTC Core Creator field additionally. In many countries, the Image Creator must be attributed in association with any use of the image. The Image Creator, Copyright Owner, Image Supplier and Licensor may be the same or different entities. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Image Registry Entry** \[IPTC Extension\]  
This entry area contains both a Registry Organisation Identifier and a Registry Item Identifier to record any registration of this digital image with a registry. Typically an ID from a registry is negotiated and applied after the creation of the digital image. Any user interface implementation must show both sub-properties - Item ID and Organisation ID - as corresponding values. Further an input to both fields should be made mandatory.

**Image Supplier ID (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this optional field to identify the most recent supplier of the image by a recognized ID such as a PLUS ID or Company URL (this may not necessarily be its owner or creator. It could be a stock agency, library, or other distributor). If the PLUS-ID being stored in this field is registered with the PLUS Coalition, it should be expressed as a URL. For example: [http://plus-id.org/PLUS-ID](http://plus-id.org/PLUS-ID "http://plus-id.org/PLUS-ID"). This property succeeds the Provider property of IPTC Core 1.0 by its semantics as that Provider was renamed to Credit Line.

**Image Supplier Name (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to identify the most recent supplier of the image by name (this may not necessarily be its owner or creator. It could be a stock agency, library, or other distributor). For identifying the supplier please use a well known and/or registered company name. This property inherits the semantics of the previous “Provider” field (IPTC Core 1.0), which was renamed “Credit line.

**Instructions** \[IPTC Core\]  
This is a simple text field that can include any of a number of instructions from the provider or creator to the receiver of the photograph. Any of the following might be included: embargoes (eg: News Magazines OUT) and other restrictions not covered by the Rights Usage Terms field (or new PLUS rights related fields); information regarding the original means of capture (scanning notes, color profile, etc.) or other specific text information the user may need for accurate reproduction; additional permissions or credits required when publishing.**_  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Instructions” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._**

_Examples:  
_Image to be used one time only, non-exclusive in English-language-edition magazine as inside image, no larger than a full page in color. Additional third-party rights to be negotiated with Julie Doe / XYZ Agency in advance. All rights not specifically granted are reserved. See delivery memo for specific license.

For consideration only; no reproduction in any form without prior, written permission.

**Intellectual Genre** \[IPTC Core\]  
Use this field to describe the type of use a photograph fulfills, in terms of its intellectual or journalistic characteristics. For example, at a newspaper, Intellectual Genre labels might include terms like daybook, obituary, press release, or transcript. A magazine might use terms such as actuality, interview, background, feature, summary, or wrap-up. For best results, organizations should use a set of terms from a controlled vocabulary. A sample taxonomy of “Intellectual genre” terms developed by the IPTC is available from [http://www.newscodes.org/](http://www.newscodes.org/). The [PRISM](http://prismstandard.org/ "PRISM") working group of the IDEAlliance has also developed a set of terms.

**IPTC Subject Code** \[IPTC Core\]  
This field can specify and categorize the content of a photograph by one or more subjects listed in the IPTC “Subject NewsCode” taxonomy available from [http://www.newscodes.org/](http://www.newscodes.org/). Each subject term is represented as an eight-digit numerical string in an unordered list. Only subjects from a controlled vocabulary should populate this field; enter free-choice text in the Keyword field.

**IPTC Scene** \[IPTC Core\]  
Describes what a photograph depicts, using one or more terms from the IPTC "Scene-NewsCodes." You should only enter values from the IPTC Scene controlled vocabulary (available from [http://www.newscodes.org/](http://www.newscodes.org/)). Each IPTC Scene term is represented as a six-digit numerical string in an unordered list.

**Job Identifier** \[IPTC Core\]  
You can enter a number or identifier created or issued to improve workflow handling and image tracking. Typically, the creator or image provider creates this code for transmission and routing purposes, relating it to the job for which the item is supplied._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Transmission Reference” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

**Keywords** \[IPTC Core\]  
Enter keyword terms or phrases to describe the subject of content in the photograph. Keywords may be free text (i.e., they need not from a controlled vocabulary). You may enter (or paste) any number of keywords, terms or phrases into this field. Each keyword term should be separated by a delimiter, such as a comma, though some software may allow semicolons or line returns _(note also that some applications may change the appearance of this delimiter as well, such as Photoshop changing your commas to semicolons)_. To maintain backward compatibility, no single value should exceed 64 characters. Values from the controlled vocabulary IPTC Subject Codes must be placed into the “Subject Code” field._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Keyword” field in the Description panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

_![](http://www.photometadata.org/sites/default/files/farmer_onion.jpg)_

_Example of keyword set for image of man planting onions:_  
agriculture, farm laborer, farmer, field hand, field worker, humans, occupation, people, agricultural, agronomy, crops, onions, vegetable crops, plants, vegetables, outdoors, outside, agricultural equipment, tractor, gender, male, men.

**Licensor (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
This set of fields should include information used to identify the persons or companies authorised to grant a license to use the image, or who has granted such a license for usage of the image. You can include: name, identifier, phone number, fax number, email address, and web address, for up to three licensors. For more details, see the Parties section in the PLUS schema discussed later in this guide. Note: clicking on any of the delete buttons (the "minus" button to the right of each row of the field) will remove all of the six columns in that particular row. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Location** \[IPTC Core\]  
Label introduced in IPTC Core 1.0 schema and replaced with "[Sublocation](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata#Sublocation)" in IPTC Core 1.1. While replaced by "Sublocation" in IPTC Core 1.1, it may still appear as Location in many applications.

**Location in which the image was created** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this set of fields to record the location where the photo was taken. If the location depicted in the image is different from the location where the photo was taken then the IPTC Extension field “Location Shown in the Image” should be used to note the difference. For example, if you are photographing a mountain with a telephoto lens from a distance, it is possible that you may be standing on the other side of a state or even country border.

**Location Shown in the Image** \[IPTC Extension\]  
This field provides a means to record structured data regarding the location shown in the image. This field should contain a set of values different from those in the “Location in which the image was created” section in situations where the subject shown in the image is different from the location depicted in the image.

**Max Avail Width/Height** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the maximum available width and height in pixels of the original photo from which this photo has been derived by downsizing (enter the highest available resolution for the original).

**Minor Model Age Disclosure (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Age of the youngest model pictured in the image, at the time that the image was made. This age should not be displayed to the public on open web portals and the like. But it may be used by image repositories in a B2B (Business to Business) environment, to facilitate compliance with applicable laws governing the use of the likeness of minors. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Model Age** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Age of the human model(s) at the time this image was taken in a model released image. As the information in this field is primarily to aid in searches, there is no requirement regarding the order of the ages if there is more than one model in the image. Adding age information is optional, and we recommend that you do not guess at the age(s) of the models, but only enter that information if the age of the model is known. The user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models. Ages below 18 years should not be included.

**Model Release Identifier(s) (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to indicate the ID for each Model Release. Be sure to give a unique number or name to all releases (both model and property), and record that information in this field. If you don’t already include an ID name/number on your releases, consider adding one as this will make it easier to cross reference. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Model Release Status (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]

This field summarises the availability and scope of model releases authorizing usage of the likenesses of persons appearing in the photograph. There are four possible values:

-   None (no release is available)
-   Not Applicable (there are no recognizable people in the image),
-   Unlimited Model Releases (releases are available for all people in the image), and
-   Limited or Incomplete Model Releases (there are releases for some of the people in the image).

We recommend that the PLUS controlled value Unlimited Model Releases (MR-UMR) be used sparingly, and encourage you to check the wording of the model release thoroughly before choosing this value. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property that is included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Person Shown in the Image** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to note the name of a person or persons shown in the image. Typically these would be recorded as they would be typed in a query, first name / last name (given name / surname). If indicating more than one name, you can use commas, or semicolons to separate the names.

**Object Name** \[IPTC IIM\]  
Alternative label from older IPTC IIM schema; used for "[Title](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata#Title)."

**Original Transmission Reference** \[IPTC IIM\]  
Alternative label from older IPTC IIM schema; used for "[Job Identifier](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata#Job%20Identifier)."

**Property Release Identifier(s) (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to indicate the ID for each Property Release. Be sure to give a unique number or name to all releases (both model and property), and record that information in this field. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Property Release Status (PLUS)** \[IPTC Extension\]

This field summarises the availability and scope of property releases authorising usage of the properties appearing in the photograph. There are four possible values:

-   None (no release is available),
-   Not Applicable (there are no items requiring a property release in the image),
-   Unlimited Property Releases (releases are available for all property shown in the image), and
-   Limited or Incomplete Model Releases (there are releases for some property shown in the image).

We recommend that the PLUS controlled value Unlimited Property Releases (PR-UPR) be used sparingly, and encourage you to check the wording of the property release thoroughly before choosing this value. This is a PLUS version 1.2 property included in the IPTC Extension schema.

**Photographer**  
Alternative label used by Photo Mechanic for "[Creator](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata#Creator)."

**Provider** \[IPTC Core\]  
Label introduced in IPTC Core 1.0 schema and replaced with "[Credit Line](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata#Credit%20Line)" in IPTC Core 1.1. This field is “shared” with the “Credit” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue. While replaced by "Credit Line" in IPTC Core 1.1, it may still appear as Provider in many applications.

**Province/State** \[IPTC Core\]  
Alternative label, used for "[State/Province](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-Field-Guide-to-Metadata#State/Province%20(legacy))."

**Province/State (of Location Shown)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the name of a subregion of a country –such as a province or state - of the location which is shown in the image. Since the abbreviation for a State or Province may be unknown to those viewing your metadata internationally, consider using the full spelling of the name. This element is at the third level of a top-down geographical hierarchy.

**Province/State (of Location Created)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the name of a subregion of a country – such as a province or state - of the location where the image was created. Since the abbreviation for a State or Province may be unknown to those viewing your metadata internationally, consider using the full spelling of the name. This element is at the third level of a top-down geographical hierarchy.

**Registry Item Identifier (of Image Registry Entry)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
A unique identifier created by a registry and applied by the current manager of the digital image. This value should not be changed after being applied. This identifier is linked to a corresponding Registry Organization Identifier, see above. This identifier may be globally unique itself, but it must be unique for the issuing registry.

**Registry Organisation Identifier (of Image Registry Entry)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to enter an identifier for the registry which issued the corresponding Registry Image ID used in the field above. As one example, if the identifier for the image was issued by the PLUS Registry this field takes an identifier for this registry as whole, such as [http://www.plus-id.org](http://www.plus-id.org/ "http://www.plus-id.org").

**Rights Usage Terms** \[IPTC Core\]  
The Rights Usage Terms field should include free-text instructions on how the photograph can be legally used. If submitting the image(s) for consideration only, you can indicate that, and stipulate no reproduction is allowed without first negotiating permission. Use the [PLUS](http://www.photometadata.org/META-Resources-metadata-types-standards-PLUS "PLUS Metadata Schema") fields of the IPTC Extension in parallel to express the license in more controlled terms. It is strongly encouraged that you use a standardized set of terms or controlled vocabulary when populating this field.

**Source** \[IPTC Core\]  
The Source field should identify the original owner or copyright holder of the photograph. The value of this field should never be changed after the information is first entered. While not yet enforced by the custom panels, you should consider this to be a “write-once” field. The source could be an individual, an agency or a member of an agency. To aid in later searches, separate any slashes “/” with a blank space. Use the form “photographer / agency” rather than “photographer/agency.” Source may also be different from Creator and from the names listed in the Copyright Notice._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “Source” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info dialogue._

**Source (of Artwork/Object)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
If you know the name of the organisation or body that holds or has registered the artwork or object in the image for inventory purposes, you can indicate that in this field.

Province/State is at the second level of a top-down geographical hierarchy._  
Note: This field is “shared” with the “State/Province” field in the Origin panel of the Adobe Photoshop File Info field._

**Sublocation** \[IPTC Core\]  
Enter the name of the sublocation shown in the image. This might be the name of a specific area within a city (Manhattan), or the name of a well-known place (Pyramids of Giza), monument or natural feature outside a city (Grand Canyon). Location is the most specific term, at the fourth level of a top-down geographical hierarchy.

**Sublocation (of Location Created)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the name of the sublocation of the location where the image was created. This sublocation name could be the name of a specific area within a city (Manhattan) or the name of a well-known location (Pyramids of Giza) or (natural) monument outside a city (Grand Canyon). This might be, for example, the street address of a building, the name of a stadium, or other structure within a city. Since sublocations are something more specific than a city this narrowest element is at the fifth level of a top-down geographical hierarchy if it is inside a city or at the fourth level if outside a city.

**Sublocation (of Location Shown)** \[IPTC Extension\]  
Use this field to record the name of the sublocation which is shown in the image. This could either be the name of a borough or territorial division of a city or the name of a well known location or (natural) monument outside a city.

This optional identifier may be assigned by the Image Supplier to an image in order to facilitate management of the image in Image Supplier systems.

**Title** \[IPTC Core\]  
This field can include a shorthand reference for the image or “photograph” - primarily for identification. The title of an image should be a short, human-readable name - text and/or numeric reference - and may take several forms. For photographers, this might be the filename of their original scan or digital camera file. For news organizations it might be the name of a story it accompanies. The Title term should not be confused with the Headline term, which is a short synopsis of the photograph's content._
