## Creating your account

Open the browser you use to authenticate and work in Google Drive/Gmail.
Go to any "Google page" like the search, Gmail, or Drive.
1. Click on the Google Apps icon in the top left of the screen.
2. Scroll down and choose the **OpenVPN on Linode** app from the list near the bottom.

3. Authenticate using your Google Account.

4. The instance does not have a certificate, you will have to allow your browser to proceed. Click on Advanced
5. Click on `Proceed to 45.56.105.91 (unsafe).` I promise it is ok.

6. As I expect you already have an OpenVPN client, you only need to download the **Connection profile**

7. You should now open your VPN application and import the new profile you just downloaded.
